# Project scope

## In scope

- Input: XMI export generated by **Modelio** (UML class models)
- Parse and transform:
  - UML classes
  - attributes (ownedAttribute)
  - operations (ownedOperation + ownedParameter)
  - generalization (inheritance) — milestone
  - associations + multiplicities — milestone
  - packages (as namespaces) — milestone

- Output: Python OOP code skeletons
  - classes
  - `__init__` (optional, based on mapping rules)
  - method stubs with `pass`
  - type hints (best-effort)

## Out of scope (initially)

- Activity diagrams, state machines, sequence diagrams (except as references)
- Full code implementations / business logic generation
- Supporting XMI from other UML tools

## Definition of “professional-grade”

- Deterministic outputs (stable generation)
- Clear contract for supported Modelio XMI
- Automated tests (unit + golden fixtures)
- CI-ready (lint, typing, tests)
- Maintainable architecture (parser → IR → mapping → generator)

## Backward compatibility

Outputs may evolve before 1.0.0, but changes must be accompanied by:
- updated fixtures
- updated golden expected outputs
- documented rationale in CHANGELOG (added later)
